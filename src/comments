COMMENT: 
A stereo calibration was compared using the previously estimated monocular intrinsics (RMS ≈ 6.5) with an alternative approach in which 
all intrinsic parameters were re-estimated jointly during stereo calibration (RMS ≈ 4.5).

Although this second method slightly modifies some of the monocular intrinsic parameters, it provides a significantly lower reprojection 
error and results in more consistent rectified image pairs and disparity maps. For this reason, the final stereo calibration used in the
project is the second one (RMS ≈ 4.5), as it offers a better overall trade-off between accuracy and practical performance of the stereo
pipeline.
